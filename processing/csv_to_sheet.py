Usage:
    python csv_to_sheet.py messy_interests.csv
Reads the CSV produced by an earlier run, removes follower-count rows,
replaces the full LinkedIn URLs with just the profile handle, and appends
the cleaned rows to the *data* tab in Google Sheet.

Relies on the helper functions already defined in tools.py:
    - clean_rows(raw_rows)
    - push_to_gsheet(rows)
